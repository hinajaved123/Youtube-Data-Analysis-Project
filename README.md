The YouTube Data Analysis Project focuses on exploring and analyzing YouTube channel/video data to uncover insights about audience engagement, video performance, and content trends. The project uses Python along with key data science libraries to clean, process, and visualize large datasets.

The aim is to demonstrate how data analytics can help content creators and businesses make data-driven decisions on YouTube strategies such as video topics, upload frequency, and audience targeting.

ðŸ”¹ Objectives

Analyze video performance metrics such as views, likes, dislikes, and comments.

Identify top-performing videos and factors contributing to their popularity.

Perform trend analysis to understand how engagement evolves over time.

Visualize data to provide actionable insights for YouTube content creators.

ðŸ”¹ Tools & Technologies

Python â†’ Core programming language for analysis.

Pandas â†’ Data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis (handling CSV/JSON YouTube datasets).

NumPy â†’ Numerical operations and handling arrays for efficient calculations.

Matplotlib â†’ Data visualization (bar charts, line plots, scatter plots, histograms).

(Optional: If you used Jupyter Notebook, mention it as the environment)

ðŸ”¹ Workflow

Data Collection â†’ Import YouTube dataset (CSV/JSON).

Data Cleaning & Preparation â†’ Handle missing values, format dates, normalize metrics.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â†’ Use Pandas & NumPy to compute descriptive statistics.

Visualization â†’ Create meaningful plots with Matplotlib (e.g., views vs. likes, top 10 videos, monthly trends).

Insights & Conclusions â†’ Summarize findings to show what drives YouTube engagement.
